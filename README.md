<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


### Why?
I don't have patience for manual, but specially repetitive work. I've done a bunch of scripts thus fur,
for different matters; and I've decided to finally take the time, and centralize them in a single place.


## ⚡️ Quick start

Just, ensure you have the necessary tools installed. Some of those are:
- 🧰 [Dagger.io](https://dagger.io/) - for some reusable pipelines.
- 🧰 Go — justified mostly for **[Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io/)**
- 🧰 [TaskFile](https://taskfile.dev/#/) — for the automation of the tasks.
